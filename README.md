## Resource Manager

This tool is initially to help manage demand and resource levelling across many projects in an enterprise. 
At this stage it expects input from a powerBi report out of Microsoft Project Server and thus works on allocations per month rather than project tasks.

Its early stages right now, we are looking for help in:

* styling - its default Bootstrap right now :vomit:
* reporting - building reports as needed, but input would be good.
* CRUD expansion, I am only updating cruds as I need them
* fancy alogrithms - there are a bunch like controlled annealing to allow some automation in resource allocation, it would be nice to have.

Yes it is currently Laravel 10 based, not 11. Bleading edge, especially for major changes is not my thing.
