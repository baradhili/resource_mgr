## Resource Manager

![Code Rabbit Pull Reviews](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-pr/baradhili/resource_mgr.svg)


This tool is initially to help manage demand and resource levelling across many projects in an enterprise. Now being extended to manage a practice/s.
It thinks from a point of view of resource management rather than project tasks - unlike most resource management tools. 

Its early stages right now, we are looking for help in:

* styling - its default Bootstrap right now :vomit:
* fancy alogrithms - there are a bunch like controlled annealing to allow some automation in resource allocation, it would be nice to have.

## Features

    - Manage Resources: contracts, leave, skills
    - Receive Demands  - estimate work required and allocate resources
    - View allocations of resources and if necessary remove resources from projects (puts the demand back into the pool)
    - Create a Service catalogue with associates required skills and estimated effort
    - Basic Skill library with imports using RSD
    - Estimate creation and management - optionally linked to services and projects

Yes it is currently Laravel 11 based, not 12. But several of the packages don't yet support 12.
